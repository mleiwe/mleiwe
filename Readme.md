## Who am I
I'm a Data Scientist with a strong background and interest in the life sciences. I currently work for [MetaCell](www.metacell.us) as a data scientist where I've worked on projects ranging from MRI processing all the way through to bioinformatics. Prior to that I was an Assistant Professor at Kyushu University.

In my spare time I also volunteer as an AI Engineer for [FruitPunch AI](https://www.fruitpunch.ai/) where I work on a whole range of interesting projects. Including facial recognitions for Sea Turtles
